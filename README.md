#Machine learning/Artificial intelligence EHR Software I built using Tapyr Appsilon Template for Shiny for Python

#Features:
This is a Machine learning/Artificial intelligence EHR Software I built using Shiny for Python to help physicians predict each patient who is at risk of developing Hypertension or Diabetes using various machine learning models in a resource-limited setting. The app leverages supervised machine learning models to predict whether a patient is at risk of developing hypertension or diabetes. The app includes a variety of machine learning models and statistical techniques for data exploration, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals.
